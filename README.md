# Smart AC Proof of Concept
One of our clients wants to create a smart air conditioner. This project is a proof of concept of a backend system which integrates with all of their airconditioning units and provides them with an admin panel to manage their system. It contains an HTTP API for the AC units to connect to and a simple web app to serve as an admin panel for this AC company.


# Running Application

To run the application. Make sure you first have docker installed 

After that, you simply run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

After that you navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your browser for the Admin Panel
